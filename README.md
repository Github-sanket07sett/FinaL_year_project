# Smart Petrol Pump System
A smart petrol dispensing system using Arduino Mega, NodeMCU (ESP8266), RFID authentication, and Firebase. The system authenticates users using RFID cards, checks balance from Firebase, dispenses fuel accordingly, and updates the transaction details in real time.
## üìå FEATURES
‚úÖ RFID-based user authentication

üí∞ Real-time balance verification from Firebase

‚õΩ Fuel dispensing controlled via relay 

üîÅ Live transaction updates pushed to Firebase

üïí Timestamped transaction history

üñ•Ô∏è OLED/I2C LCD support for on-site display

üîÅ Bidirectional Serial Communication between Arduino Mega and NodeMCU
## üì≤ Firebase Setup
1. Go to Firebase Console.
2. Create a new Realtime Database project.
3. Set rules to allow read/write access:
4. Copy the Database URL and Legacy Token and add it to your NodeMCU sketch.

## üß† System Workflow
1. User scans RFID card
2. NodeMCU checks Firebase for balance
3. If authenticated, Arduino receives "OK" with balance and allows fuel dispensing
4. Fuel is dispensed based on the balance and amount entered via keypad
5. Flow sensor measures dispensed amount
6. Firebase updates balance, dispensed amount, and timestamp
